# AWS FreePascal Custom Runtime

A bare bones FreePascal Custom Runtime for AWS Lambda

The custom runtime allows you to use FreePascal natively on AWS Lambda without any side-loading or hacky tricks.

This is the core skeleton and contains no functionality other than the basic setup and event polling.

Use it as-is for max performance, or wait for the webserver one (Coming soon) which lets you easily use fpHttpServer (Equivalent to using Express.js with the Node.js runtime)
